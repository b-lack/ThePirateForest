# The Pirate Forest
Discover Treasures of Forest-related Open Source Software.

## Motivation
You actually wanted to be a pirate, but then you became a forester?

I built [The Pirate Forest](https://b-lack.github.io/ThePirateForest/) to get an overview of current forest specific open source software. There you can store, sort and manage your favorite repositories.
